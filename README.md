# House-Price-Prediction-Neural-Network
It processes real estate data, selects key features, scales values, and trains a neural network model using Keras with ReLU activation. The model is evaluated with RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics, and visualizations like scatter plots and training loss graphs provide insights. Built with Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

**Requirements:** Python 3.12

**Note:** This project was developed using Spyder(6.0.1) from the Anaconda Navigator, which comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If you're also using Spyder within Anaconda, you may already have most of these packages.

**Important:** Place the CSV file (kc_house_data.csv) in the same folder as the Python file (HousePricePredictionANN.py) so the script can locate it without additional configuration. Additionally, TensorFlow installation may be required. To install it, enter "!pip install tensorflow" in the IPython Console.
